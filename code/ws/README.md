# ws

I have done several jobs for this independent internet agency. Work includes both back-end and front-end using
various frameworks.

## music director

I had a hand in developing the back-end import for this stock music platform. 

Built with the Yii2 framework with a Gearman job server processing background tasks.

## pmt

A website built with wordpress, but with a modern development workflow. 

Back-end was built with Wordpress through Composer, Docker and NodeJS.

Front-end with jQuery, Bootstrap and SCSS.

## newsroom

User friendly web-interface for very large and well-known newsroom automation software.

I set up the entire front-end project, with modern tooling, testing and deployment using:
React, ES6 (babel) and Webpack, SCSS, Swagger (specs and mock server), Gitlab+CI, Karma/Nightwatch/Selenium and Docker.
